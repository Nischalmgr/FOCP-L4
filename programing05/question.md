1)Using command-line arguments involves the sys module. Review the docs for this
module and using the information in there write a short program that when run
from the command-line reports what operating system platform is being used.

2)Write a program that, when run from the command line, reports how many
arguments were provided. (Remember that the program name itself is not an
argument).

3)Write a program that takes a bunch of command-line arguments, and then prints
out the shortest. If there is more than one of the shortest length, any will do.
Hint: Don't overthink this. A good way to find the shortest is just to sort them.
4)Write a program that takes a URL as a command-line argument and reports
whether or not there is a working website at that address.
Hint: You need to get the HTTP response code.
Another Hint: StackOverflow is your friend.

5)Last week you wrote a program that processed a collection of temperature readings
entered by the user and displayed the maximum, minimum, and mean. Create a
version of that program that takes the values from the command-line instead. Be
sure to handle the case where no arguments are provided!

6)Write a program that takes the name of a file as a command-line argument, and
creates a backup copy of that file. The backup should contain an exact copy of the
contents of the original and should, obviously, have a diï¬€erent name.
Hint: By now, you should be getting the idea that there is a built-in way to do the
